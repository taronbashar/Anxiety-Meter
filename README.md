# Anxiety-Meter
Device designed to record biosignals (heart rate and galvanic skin response) and provide status of anxiety level for the individual by discerning between a generalized anxiety attack and a panic attack. Predetermined threshold for detection was obtained from previously published papers and chronic data logging for biosignals visualized on graphs are displayed on a local host web server using a static IP address. 

Additional information regarding the device is displayed in the slides below:

Furthermore, device was programmed to sleep after no detection from heart rate sensor on three continuous checks and the device was set to wake up from sleep and check for heart rate every couple of minutes and turn on wifi module for data transmission after positive recognition.
